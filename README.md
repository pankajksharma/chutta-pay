- This application allows transfer of funds from one person to other.
- Gives a unique code to each  of the  user, a transaction can take place between two users with just  sharing  of the 4 digit pin.
- The main use case of this  application can be at places where the  seller is not able to return  change to customer, he can use this  application to transfer change to  customer.
- Limit on maximum amount that can be transferred, this way limiting only to small amount transactions.
- Once an upper limit on account is received, we can easily transfer funds to the user's bank account.
-  We will create a really simple application that allows transfer  of  funds using a very basic GUI that only has a form for entering the  pin  of the receiving person.
